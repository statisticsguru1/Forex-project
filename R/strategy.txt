# my approach 
1) collect forex price data every minute and push save it to Database [98% complete]
2) Develop model to predict future prices, compute variation between real and predicted prices, also a script to set bounds (python/R)[50% complete], 
3) Develop an expert advisor to receive predicted prices and also manage orders.[0% done]

# In future
1) Collect image data, datetime, Order type,price,bounds results(Profit/loss). from users
2) analyze it with deep learning to build a model which can validate the predictions made before orders are placed
3) Collect frequency of movements to be able to detect and predict sharp movements ahead
